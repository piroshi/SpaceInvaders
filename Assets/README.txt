Comments

- I didn't use an atlas because I used very few images 
- I wanted to implement a sound manager but there were very sounds in the game so I just added directly in the code
- I didn't use a pool system for the enemies because they never respawn during the game and when they are created the games have plenty of time to instantiate them because it pause every time an enemy is created
